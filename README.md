# Viral-Content-Project

### Identifying viral content and diversity in ancient and modern dental calculus samples

**Summary of Project**

Investigating the viral content of both modern and ancient dental calculus samples collected from varying locations across the globe. Observing the diversity and complexity of the human oral virome and how these conditions have changed dependent on time and geographic location. 

**Project Context**

Track changes in viral population diversity and viral genomes dependent on time and geography 

**Project Aims**

 1. To detect and identify viruses within modern day dental calculus samples
 2. To determine the diversity of modern-day viruses within dental calculus and compare the extent of diversity observed between Australian and American samples
 3. To determine whether viruses present in modern-day humans can be detected in ancient European individuals
 4. To explore whether the ancient oral virome has changed in response to time and geography

**Approach Summary**
Bioinformatic analysis techniques will be used to address the above listed aims. These will include the processing and analysis of already obtained and sequenced data (from ACAD and HMP). Processing will involve multiple stages which will be explored through this repository. 

**Data**
 #### - ACAD Sequence Files
 - Received 38 dental calculus samples from modern Australian individuals, known as the Australian dataset.
 #### - HMP Sequence Files
- sequence data obtained from the Human Microbiome Project, including data obtained from the three oral sites: Tongue Dorsum, Supragingival Plaque and Buccal Mucosa.
- A total of 2 individuals with each of the above mentioned oral sites sampled were selected. The two individuals (6 samples total) were subsampled to 10 million reads using the following script:
- This data will be known as the American dataset.
 #### - Ancient ACAD Data
- A total of 6 dental calculus samples from three locations across Greater London and surrounding areas dating back up to 2,000 years were selected. 
- This data will be known as the Ancient dataset
