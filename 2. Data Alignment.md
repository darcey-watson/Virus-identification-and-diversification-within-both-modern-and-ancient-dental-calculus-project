Data Alignment
=============

**Goal**

This stage of the project involved the aligning of the prviously processed modern data (uman oral acad and hmp) against a created database which involved HOMD, an accession database from the ncbi and a viral database as obtained from virusite. By aligning these databases it is possible to determine what species of virus are present in the human oral microbiome. This alignment will essentially map the modern data and the created databases against one another to observe any matches and overlaps

## 1. Collecting Database Elements
#### The following databases were collected to construct the databases:
 - HOMD (Human Oral Microbiome Database)
	 - Obtained from:
 - NCBI
	 - Obtained from: http://ab.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/data/software/megan6/download/welcome.html 
	 - Direct NCBI download of all viral genomes
		* To obtain these genomes download the following program:
		
    conda install -c bioconda ncbi-genome-download
    		* To then commence the download of all of the viral genomes complete the following:
		
    ncbi-genome-download --format fast viral --assembly-level complete
    
 - Virusite
	 - Obtained from: http://www.virusite.org/index.php?nav=download 


## 2. Constructing the Databases
To create the database that the modern data needs to be compared to we will use MALT through its MALT build function. 
This will be completed using the following commands:

#### MALT was installed via:

#### To run the reads the following commands were entered:

    module load malt

#### The script to be entered to create the initial database (HOMD and NCBI only) is the following:
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH -p highmem
    #SBATCH -N 1
    #SBATCH -n 30
    #SBATCH --time=05:00:00
    #SBATCH --mem=250GB
    
    #Notification configuration
    #SBATCH --mail-type=END
    #SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL
    #SBATCH --mail-user=(email address)
 
    malt-build -i (input database: HOMD) \
    -d (output) \
    -a2taxonomy (annotated accession numbers: NCBI) \
    --sequenceType DNA -t 30 -v

#### The script to be entered to create the viral database (HOMD, NCBI and Virusite) is the following:

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH -p highmem
    #SBATCH -N 1
    #SBATCH -n 30
    #SBATCH --time=05:00:00
    #SBATCH --mem=250GB
    
    #Notification configuration
    #SBATCH --mail-type=END
    #SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL
    #SBATCH --mail-user=(email address)
 
    malt-build -i (input: HOMD and Virusite) \
    -d (output) \
    -a2taxonomy (annotated accession numbers: NCBI) \
    --sequenceType DNA -t 30 -v 
    
* To complete this step it is first neccessary to move all of the input sources i.e. Homd and Virusite into the same directory. Once inside they must be the same file type so as to ensure both files are recognised. In this case the HOMD database was renamed .fasta to make it recognisable. This step will allow for only 1 input to be entered with all data obtained, thus making the process much simpler.

## 3. Database Alignment
To align the modern data with the above created aligned database, MALT will again be used with its MALTrun funciton. This will result in ()(files that have compared and aligned the modern data to the developed database so that each of the sequences in the modern data samples can be aligned to its closest annotated sequences from the database

#### Malt has already been installed (see above step 2.)

#### To run the reads the following commands need to be entered:

    module load malt
    sbatch (Jobscript name)

#### The script to be entered to run the alignment is the following:

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH -p highmem
    #SBATCH -N 1
    #SBATCH -n 32
    #SBATCH --time=30:00:00
    #SBATCH --mem=1500GB
    
    #Notification configuration
    #SBATCH --mail-type=END
    #SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL
    #SBATCH --mail-user=(email address)
    FG
    malt-run \
    -i (input: data) \
    -a (output) \
    -ou (output: same as above) \
    -at SemiGlobal -f Text -d (database: output from MALT Build) \
    -mem load --mode BlastN -t 32 -v
    ~
    ~
    ~


## 4. Aligned Database Conversion

#### Blast2RMA was already installed as part of the ()()( package. It is possible to check whether Blast2RMA is already installed via:

    module spider blast2rma

#### To run the reads the following commands need to be entered:

    module load malt
    module load parallel

#### The script to be entered to run the alignment is the following:

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH -p highmem
    #SBATCH -N 1
    #SBATCH -n 32
    #SBATCH --time=15:00:00
    #SBATCH --mem=500GB
    
    #Notification configuration
    #SBATCH --mail-type=END
    #SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL
    #SBATCH --mail-user=(email address)
    
    for i in (input) \
    do b=${i%.fa*}.blastn.gz; echo blast2rma -r $i -i $b \
    -o (output) \
    -ms 44 -me 0.01 -f BlastText -a;g weighted -lcp 80; done | parallel -j28 --delay 6
