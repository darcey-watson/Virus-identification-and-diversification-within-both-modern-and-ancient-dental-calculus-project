**Data Alignment**
This stage of the project involved the aligning of the prviously processed modern data (uman oral acad and hmp) against a created database which involved HOMD, an accession database from the ncbi and a viral database as obtained from virusite via the following link:

**Collecting Database Elements**
homd
ncbi
virusite
**Creating the Database**
To create the database that the modern data needs to be compared to we will use MALT through its MALT build function. his will be  used through activating the following commands:

The script to run the MALTBuild and combine the above mentioned collection database elements is the following:

**Aligning Data with the Database**
To align the modern data with the above created aligned database, MALT will again be used with its MALTrun funciton. This will result in ()(files that have compared the and aligned the modern data to the developed database so that each of the sequences in the modern data samples can be aligned to its closest annotated sequences from the database
