Producing statistical interpretaions
=========================

#### Goal
To analyse the datasets and observe any differences within identifications and diversity through both alpha and beta diversity, QIIME2 will be used.  

#### Tasks
[1. Create neccessary input for QIIME2](https://github.com/darcey-watson/Viral-Content-Project/blob/master/6.%20Producing%20Statistics.md#1-create-neccessary-input)

[2. Run alpha and beta diversity](https://github.com/darcey-watson/Viral-Content-Project/blob/master/6.%20Producing%20Statistics.md#2-run-alpha-and-beta-diversity)

[3. Visualise results](https://github.com/darcey-watson/Viral-Content-Project/blob/master/6.%20Producing%20Statistics.md#3-visualisation-of-statistics) 

## 1. Create neccessary input

QIIME2 was able to be used on the local machine. 

**QIIME2 can be downloaded via the following code:**

    conda update conda
    conda install wget
    wget https://data.qiime2.org/distro/core/qiime2-2019.7-py36-osx-conda.yml
    conda env create -n qiime2-2019.7 --file qiime2-2019.7-py36-osx-conda.yml

**with an optional but recommended clean up:**

    rm qiime2-2019.7-py36-osx-conda.yml

Once downloaded it was neccessary to prepare the input files on MEGAN6. QIIME2 requires a biom table and mapping file directly from MEGAN6

* To create the biom file on MEGAN6 it was neccessary to select file, export and from the drop down option 2 which is BIOM1format. You then want to say yes to exporting the taxa at official ranks only. This will then save the file as a .biom to the selected location. The Biom table when exported directly from MEGAN is not yet acceptable to QIIME2 and so some alterations are required:
Firstly, you need to convert your biom file to a txt file:

   

	    biom convert -i (input directly from MEGAN6.biom) -o (output name you select (biom table name as above .biom).txt --to-tsv

	Once converted open the text file in Microsoft Excel. Here you need to remove the first line and change #OTUID to FeatureID.
Following these alterations the text file needed to be converted back to a .biom file;

	    biom convert -i (biom table name).txt -o (biome table name)_updated.biom --table-type="OTU table" --to-hdf5

	Once the Biom table has been fixed it is neccesary to convert the table to a QIIME2 artefact.
	
	**The script to be entered is:**

	    qiime tools import \
		--input-path (biom table name)_updated.biom \
		--type 'FeatureTable[Frequency]' \
		--input-format BIOMV210Format \
		--output-path (biom table name)_updated.qza
* In order to create the mapping file through MEGAN6 select file, export, then Metadata. Once saved as a txt file, the file was opened in excel where additional headers including factors tested were added. QIIME2 requires headers in a specific order which reads: #SampleID, BarcodeSequence, LinkerPrimerSequence, tested factors, Description.

When adding potential influencing factors it was necessary to keep entries concise as these were used for later graphing.
Note: If any data was unknown the cell was not left blank, instead filled with NA. 
Once these steps are completed all necessary input is available 

Once uploaded (through the above qiime tools import) to QIIME2 it was essential to summarise the biom table to allow for later visualisation.

**Biom table summaries were completed using the following script:**

    qiime feature-table summarize \
	  --i-table (biom table name)_updated.qza \
	  --o-visualization (biom table name)_updated.qzv \
	  --m-sample-metadata-file metadata file.txt

## 2. Run alpha and beta-diversity
In order to get metrics from both alpha and beta diversity, running 'core metrics' was most efficient. 
**In order to run this command enter the following code:**

    qiime diversity core-metrics \
	  --i-table (biom table name)_updated.qza \
	  --p-sampling-depth (determined through observing minimum coverage depth from qiime feature-table summarize) \
	  --m-metadata-file (mapping file).txt  \
	  --output-dir core-metrics-results

Note: This is for non-phylogenetic analysis

By running this command it was possible to access all statistics needed for the completion of the project with the output offering bray curtis distance metric, evenness vector, jaccard distance, observed OTU's, rarefied table and shannon significance. The three metrics used in this particular project are alpha-diversity observed OTU's and beta-diversity Bray Curtis and Jaccard metrics. Each of the required outputs except for observed OTU's contain a .qzv option which allows for visualisation through QIIME2 View which is available through the QIIME2 website.

**In order to obtain the .qzv option for observed OTU's the following command needs to be run:**
 
     qiime diversity alpha-group-significance \
	  --i-alpha-diversity core-metrics-results/observed_otus_vector.qza \
	  --m-metadata-file mappingfile.txt \
	  --o-visualization core-metrics-results/observed_otus_vector_significance.qzv 

#### Graphing for certain factors:
To graph for certain factors, ie. the impact of location on a dataset it was necessary to complete additional scripts.
Firstly, it was crucial to include any possible variables in the mapping file. For use in this project that included location, oral site, age of sample and database used.

**Separation between databases used was necessary within this project and so to select one database at a time for testing the following commands were run:**

    qiime feature-table filter-samples \
	  --i-table (biom table name)_updated.qza \
	  --m-metadata-file (mapping file).txt \
	  --p-where "Database='name'" \
	  --o-filtered-table (biom table name_database name).qza

Note: -p indicates the variable ie. database you would like to keep for graphing.

With the creation of the new biom table it was neccessary to re-summarise the biom table.

**To re-summarise use the following script:**

    qiime feature-table summarize \
	  --i-table (biom table name_database name).qza \
	  --o-visualization (biom table name_database name).qzv \
	  --m-sample-metadata-file (mapping file).txt

Following the creation of the new biom table it was possible to re-run the core diversity metrics and the observed otu's alpha diversity significance scripts again and have them specific to the factors. 

This script was repeated for both of the selected databases as when the databases were combined the main driver behind diversity was the databases as opposed to any tested variables. 

## 3. Visualisation of Statistics
Visualisation through QIIME2 View only allowed for 3D plots to be observed and so to obtain a 2d pCOA plot QIIME1 was used.

**QIIME1 was downloaded via the following command:**

    conda create -n qiime1 python=2.7 qiime matplotlib=1.4.3 mock nose -c bioconda

To create pCOA plots the appropriate .qzv's from QIIME2 were run through the make_2d_plots script from QIIME1. 

**The script for make_2d_plots can be seen below:**

    make_2d_plots.py -i (.qzv output from QIIME2) -m (mapping file) -b (factor to graph by, eg. location)

This resulted in .html files which had all pCOA plot axes options for selection.
