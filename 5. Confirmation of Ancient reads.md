## Ancient DNA confirmation
#### Goal
This stage of the project confirms that the ancient DNA used within the project is in fact ancient in nature. 

#### Tasks
[1. Analyse ancient sequence reads to confirm ancient status 
using damageprofiler2](https://github.com/darcey-watson/Viral-Content-Project/blob/master/5.%20Confirmation%20of%20Ancient%20reads.md#1--analysis-of-ancient-data)

### 1.  Analysis of ancient data
To analyse the ancient nature of DNA damage plots need to be created using a computational program such as damageprofiler2.

damageprofiler2 is available to download through conda using the following script:

    conda create -n damageprofiler -c bioconda damageprofiler

In order to create damage plots it is necessary to run a for loop with both the ancient sequence of interest (BAM output from BWA) and the exact viral reference sequence that it was mapped to through BWA

It is possible to link for loops together to create a continuous script for producing all damage plots if multiple ancient samples are present. However, for simplicity I have included one for loop here as an example:

    for i in (input ancient sequence)/*.BAM;
    do
	    damageprofiler -i $i -r (viral reference sequence) -o (output directory)
	    done 

By running this script you will receive an output containing several files including a pdf titled 'DamagePlot.pdf' which will show damage patterns from both a 5' and 3' end. The desired pattern to indicate ancient origins is a 'smiley face' pattern with peaks at opposing ends of the graphs. However, this pattern will only be achievable to view in samples with over 500 bp's
