Data Observations
=============================

**Goals**

Graph and interpret the data obtained in a palatable and comparable way to allow clear visualisation of results, visually indicating any differences and similarities in the dataset.

**Tasks**

 1. [Observing Data](https://github.com/darcey-watson/Viral-Content-Project/blob/master/3.%20Data%20Observations.md#1-observing-the-data)

## 1. Observing the Data

Data observation and graphical representations will be produced through the computational program MEGAN6.

MEGAN6 version 6_17_0 was downloaded from: https://software-ab.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/download/megan6/welcome.html

This program allows for the phylogenic seperation of various bacterial, archael and viral taxa in a graphical manner. This project focuses on oral virome composition and so it was possible through this program to essentially mute any inputs other than viral sequences. 

Once MEGAN is downloaded it was neccessary to link MEGAN to an individual terminal in order for it to quickly and accurately obtain processed samples. 

To set the input directory accessible by MEGAN6 enter into the MeganServer directory, go to MeganServer-standalone, then properties and vi into the text file meganserver.properties. Here it was necessary to link  a root folder (where all of the input files for MEGAN6 are located). After the absolute path was added, esc+w+q was selected to save and exit the text file.

In order to set the server port in which MEGAN6 will access the input files through, return to the MeganServer-standalone directory and enter the bin directory. vi into the ./start.sh text file and add a random number, which became the start port and was later entered into the MEGAN6 GUI. do the same to the ./stop.sh text file. 
#### The input files were made available by the following script:

    module load malt
    ./stop.sh
    ./start.sh
    
 The files within the root folder were then accessible in MEGAN6 when the start port number was entered. 
 
 Within MEGAN6 it was possible to investigate both family and species level of viral identification through various maps, specifically heat maps, bar charts and stacked bar charts were utilised.
