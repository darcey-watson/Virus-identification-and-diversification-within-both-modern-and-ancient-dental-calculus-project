**Data Observations**

**Goals**

Graph and interpret the data obtained in a palatable and comparable way to allow clear visualisation of results, indicating visually any differences and similarities in the dataset.

**Tasks**

 1. [Observing Data](https://github.com/darcey-watson/Viral-Content-Project/blob/master/3.%20Data%20Observations.md#1-observing-the-data)

## 1. Observing the Data

Data observation and graphical representations will be produced through the computational program MEGAN.

MEGAN6 version ()( was downloaded from:

This program allows for the phylogenic seperation of various bacterial, archael and viral taxa in a graphical manner. This project focuses on oral virome composition and so it is possible through this program to essentially mute an other inputs other than viral. 

Once MEGAN is downloaded it is neccessary to link MEGAN to an individual terminal in order for it to quickly and accurately obtain processed samples.
